        <p>1 Data Privacy Notice</p>
        <br>
        <p>1.1 General Information about the collection of personal data</p>
        <p>In the following data privacy notice we would like to explain how we handle personal data transmitted to us when using our website or our offers. Personal data is any data, which can be related to you personally, e.g. name, address, email address or user behavior.</p>
        <br>
        <p>1.2 Data Controller</p>
        <p>KEYGEM GmbH </p>
        <p>Kuhlweg 61</p>
        <p>52074 Aachen</p>

        <p>1.3 Which data does KEYGEM GmbH process?</p>
        <p>KEYGEM GmbHoffers you a wide range of services, which you may use in a wide range of ways. Depending on whether you contact us online, by phone or otherwise and on which services you use, various data from different sources may come into play. Much of the data we process is provided by you yourself when you use our services or contact us, for example when you register and provide your name or email address or address. We do, however, also receive technical device and access data which is automatically collected when you interact with our services. When you visit our website, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the website, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to our website, and information about how you interact with the website.</p>
        <p>We may also receive data on you from third parties, for example for credit rating agencies and payment service providers.</p>
        <br> 
        <p>1.4 What does KEYGEM GmbHuse my data for?</p>
        <p>KEYGEM GmbHprocesses your data in accordance with all applicable data protection laws. Of course, we observe the principles of data protection law for the processing of personal data. We therefore generally only process your data for the purposes explained to you in this Privacy Notice or shared when we collect the data. These are mainly purchase processing and the provision, personalization and development as well as security of our services. We use your data within the framework of the strict German and European data protection law, but also for other purposes such as personalized advertising and the optimization of business processes.</p>
        <p>We process your data in the necessary scope to fulfil contracts and to provide and execute further services requested by you, as described in this Privacy Notice. The purposes of the necessary data processing therefore depend on the purpose of the contract agreed with you (including our General Terms and Conditions and any service-specific terms and conditions or terms of use) or services requested by you. The most important purposes are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The provision, personalisation and needs-based design of our services such as the KEYGEM GmbHshop (including the respective website);</li>
          <li>The execution of purchase agreements and customer service including dispatch and payment processing, claim management as well as the processing of returns, complaints and warranty claims;</li>
          <li>The provision of messages, reports, newsletters and other direct communication, insofar as these are an integral component of our contractual services or the services requested by you;</li>
          <li>The guarantee of the general security, operability and stability of our service including defence from attacks;</li>
          <li>Non-promotional communication with you on technical, security-related and contractually relevant subjects (e.g. fraud warnings, account blocking or contractual changes);</li>
          <li>The issuing, redemption, delivery of KEYGEM GmbH</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>1.5 KEYGEM GmbH legal basis for processing personal data</p>
        <p>Insofar as the purpose relates to the execution of a contract agreed with you or the provision of a service requested by you, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) b GDPR. Otherwise, the legal basis is Article 6 (1) f GDPR, whereby we may use your personal data for the above purposes if we deem it necessary to do so for our legitimate interests.</p>
        <p>If you have given us your consent for the processing of personal data, your consent is the primary basis of our data processing. Which of your data we process on the basis of your consent depends on the purpose of your consent.</p>
